function [shapes] = generateShape(b, eigenvectors)
%GENERATESHAPE takes a parameter vector b as input and computes new shapes, where the length of b indicates the number of Eigenvectors to be considered for shape generation
%   b = parameter vector
%   eigenvectors = eigenvectors to be used for shape generation

shapes = b;
